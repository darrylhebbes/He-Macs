** DONE Set it up

Actually, I like the default modeline but it can get way too crowded
when adding minor modes, so let's get rid of some of them.

** TODO ARev
** TODO Eldoc

* TODO Paredit
* TODO Gnus
* TODO Theme Switcher

** DONE Toggle command

Create a toggle command between day and night theme.

** DONE Other ideas

- Maybe make it more as a theme swithing bunch of utilities instead of
  just the switch
- So maybe create a user settable variable to say whether he wants the
  theme switch at given time.  If not he can still define day and
  night themes and make easy switches

** TODO Built a toggle for the switcher

- minor mode maybe?

* TODO Defer built-in packages?
